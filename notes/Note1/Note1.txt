I think i’ll use gamemaker to code yaag
Since I couldn’t figure out godot, and no one has said anything related to coding for months, i’ll take that as a “i can do whatever i want”.
I would’ve used java, but my engine is honestly pretty bad, and gamemaker has multiple export options aswell as being more useful if i want ti teach it to others, because they could use it in the industry
To do:
Player sprites for running and standing in 8 directions
Functional 3d level editor, and system to hide walls based on rotation
Boss battle system

Level, which controls rooms and such
A player


FORMAT:
	[ A parent of something, like Root, Left Wall, ETC ]
		[ An object, like a prop ]

Root, wall and floor parents are autogenned. props can have parents within them, for moving parts.
If you parent something to a wall, when that wall is hidden by camera, the object is hidden too.
Things parented to root automatically become invisible on room unload.
